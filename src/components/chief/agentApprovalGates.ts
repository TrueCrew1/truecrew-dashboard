/**
 * OPERATING RULE — read before wiring any agent into this file:
 *
 * Planner, Build, Research, and Content agents must NEVER ask the operator
 * for approval directly (no direct messages, no side-channel asks). Each
 * agent builds its own *ApprovalRequest object and passes it through the
 * matching createApprovalCardFrom*Request() helper below. Chief is the only
 * thing that turns a request into an ApprovalCard, and the Chief Approval
 * Panel (ChiefPanel.tsx -> ApprovalBoard.tsx) is the only surface the
 * operator sees approvals on. See docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md for the repo-level
 * statement of this rule.
 *
 * This pass wires the pattern with one illustrative example request per
 * agent (clearly marked EXAMPLE_*) — not live agent output. Extension
 * point: replace each EXAMPLE_* constant with a real request object once
 * that agent's workflow actually produces one.
