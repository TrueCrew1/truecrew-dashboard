/**
 * OPERATING RULE — read before wiring any agent into this file:
 *
 * Planner, Build, Research, and Content agents must NEVER ask the operator
 * for approval directly (no direct messages, no side-channel asks). Each
 * agent builds its own *ApprovalRequest object and passes it through the
 * matching createApprovalCardFrom*Request() helper below. Chief is the only
 * thing that turns a request into an ApprovalCard, and the Chief Approval
 * Panel (ChiefPanel.tsx -> ApprovalBoard.tsx) is the only surface the
 * operator sees approvals on. See docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md for the repo-level
 * statement of this rule.
 *
 * Build's request (BUILD_REQUEST_DUPLICATE_AUTH_FIX below) is a real one,
 * grounded in verifiable repo state — not mocked. Planner/Research/Content
 * still use one illustrative example each (clearly marked EXAMPLE_*), not
 * live agent output yet. Extension point: replace each EXAMPLE_* constant
 * with a real request object once that agent's workflow actually produces
 * one, following the same pattern as Build's.
